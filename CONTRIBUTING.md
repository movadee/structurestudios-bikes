## Contributing

Developer "how-to" reference. Usually we discuss and document the following:

- Code architecture (explanation of codebase possibly with auto-generated [dependency diagram](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMZ-ReC-jWU))
- Version control management practices ([trunk-based-development example](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration/trunk-based-development))
- Single-page application rendering (client side rendering or server side rendering)
- App loading technique (lazy loading for example)
- Dependency injection strategy
- Standalone components setup
- Change detection strategy
- Forms (are there a need for Dynamic forms or maybe simple Reactive Forms setup will be enough?)
- Error and warning handling
- Testing: preferred testing methods, minimum project coverage, etc
- Internationalization setup (depending on app rendering technique)
- Accessibility standards and coding strategies to meet those standards
- Auth and security
- Environment variables management
- State management technique
- Pagination (lazy scrolling or next page buttons)
- Data representation technique (where do we mask data? backend or frontend side?)
- Optimization techniques (memoization, caching, cdn, etc.)
- Responsive app design strategy (screen breakpoints, mobile-first approach, etc.)
- Breadcrumbs
- Naming convention
- Code style guide
- API contract: how is it supposed to look so that app can achieve maximum performance
- Decisions on where it makes the most sence to store business logic (frontend vs backend)
- etc
